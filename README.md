<h1>This is my fist try-out with shopware plugins</h1>

<p>
This is my first try-out with a back-end plugin of shopware. My plugin is based from a tutorial from udemey.</br>
Here I've used all kind of methods to make this plugin like:</br>

<ul>
<li>Configuring config.xml</li>
<li>Adding controllers</li>
<li>Creating services</li>
<li>implementing snippets</li>
</ul>
</br>
This a quick overview what this repository is about.
